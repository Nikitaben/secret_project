    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>There’s a voice &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that keeps on calling &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; me. Down the road, that’s where I’ll always be. Every stop I make, I make a new friend. Can’t stay for long, just turn around and I’m gone again. <strong>Maybe tomorrow</strong>, I’ll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.</p>

      <blockquote cite="http://https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/while_loops.html">

        A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met. For example, if we want to ask a user for a number between 1 and 10, we don't know how many times the user may enter a larger number, so we keep asking "while the number is not between 1 and 10". If we (or the computer) knows exactly how many times to execute a section of code (such as shuffling a deck of cards) we use a for loop.

      <q cite="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/while_loops.html">

       The "pseudocode" for such an algorithm is: while the number is bigger than one keep dividing it by two. additionally, keep a count of how many times we do the division.

        ENDWHILE

        WHILE gallons is less then 1
            miles <- INPUT "Please enter gallons more than 0"
        ENDWHILE
        continue <- INPUT "Do you wish to contiue? (y/n):"

	IF totalGallons is not equal to 0
		PRINT "Overall MPG =" + ( totalMiles / totalGallons )
